1. To tell the Raspberry Pi to automatically connect to your WiFi network you need to edit a file called: wpa_supplicant.conf.

To open the file in nano type the following command:
 
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

2. Scroll to the end of the file and add the following to the file to configure your network: 

network={
   ssid="THESIS_TRAFFIC"
   psk="THESIS_TRAFFIC"
}
